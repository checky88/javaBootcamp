A. Allows a c lass im pl ementation to c hange without c hanging the c lients 
B. Prote c ts c onf ide ntial data from leaking out of the obje c ts 
C. Prevents c ode from c ausing ex c eptions 
D. Enables the c lass im pl ementation to prote c t its invariants
E. Pe rmits c lasses to be c ombined into the sam e pac kage 
F. Enables multi pl e instan c es of the sam e c lass to be c reated safely

answer
Option A, the encapsulated category can keep the API interface consistent, even if the internal program implementation of the transaction, do not need to change to other references to this package of good categories of programs. For example, an application uses other libraries that are encapsulated as JAR files for image processing calculations, and the library later has a new version to optimize the speed of the calculations. At this point to update the application, let it use the new version of the library, then only need to replace the JAR file can not change or re-compile the original application.

Option B, the package can hide the code to protect the confidential information leak.

Option C , the package can not prevent the occurrence of exceptions.

Option D, encapsulation can protect the category of the implementation program is not modified.

Option E, the package concept and the package is not directly related.

Option F, the encapsulation is not associated with the security of a class that is physically different.
