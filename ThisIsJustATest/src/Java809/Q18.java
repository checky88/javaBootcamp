	Explanation:
A properties file is a simple text file. You can create and maintain a properties file
with just about any text editor.
You should always create a default properties file. The name of this file begins with the base name
of your ResourceBundle and ends with the .properties suffix.
An example of the contents of a ResourceBundle file:
# This is a comment
s1 = computer
s2 = disk
s3 = monitor
s4 = keyboard
Note that in the preceding file the comment lines begin with a pound sign (#). The other lines
contain key-value pairs. The key is on the left side of the equal sign and the value is on the right.
For instance, s2 is the key that corresponds to the value disk. The key is arbitrary. We could have
called s2 something else, like msg5 or diskID. Once defined, however, the key should not change
because it is referenced in the source code. The values may be changed. In fact, when your
localizers create new properties files to accommodate additional languages, they will translate the
values into various languages.
